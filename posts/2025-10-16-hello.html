<ul>
  <li>Being too hard on myself</li>
  <li>Journaling</li>
  <li>Career Development</li>
</ul>

<p>It's Thursday and I have only made it to the office two times this week including today. Chad has asked me if I would commit to at least three times per week, so I guess I failed that goal this week.
But my workload is so stagnant, and boring right now I feel miserable. I am not creating or building anything at all. Just mindless meetings and emails. I am looking forward to the potential of moving back to the IT Team
next year in January because it will bring about new challenges, learning new technologies, skills, and potentially languages. In my head it will open a new door in my career path, but that being said if the business
does not move their feet by January, I believe it may be time to start looking elsewhere.</p>
        
<p>I am not too sure if journaling is for me or not yet, but I have always wanted to give it a try for a little bit. One thing is for sure....my handwriting is atrcious (thus why this website was created). This is why
  I prefer technology.</p>

<p>Is what I have observed in Ayden being too hard on himself also affecting me? Stacey said something the other day that triggered this thought path. Is that why I don't start things? I talk myself out of them before
  I ever start. I have been thinking about this a lot recently. How negative and pessimistic Dad was and how that affected my thought processes and habits. Not putting myself out there so to speak and what effects that has
  on my career and my life.
