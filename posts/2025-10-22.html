<p>For some reason, I could not fall asleep last night until around 1:00am. The result was I woke up late this morning which resulted in coming late into the office around 11:00am. BUT.....I did come in which is an 
improvement. Only 1 more day and that is three days this week. I need to improve my bedtime routine somehow so I can break this bad habit.</p>

<p>
  I have been doing research recently on fast dopamine versus slow dopamine. Fast dopamine examples are caffeine, video games, etc. while slow dopamine examples are things like DIY projects, reading, self-improvement, etc.
  I am <bold>VERY</bold> guilty of falling victim to mindless scrolling, watching TV, or playing video games when there are a million other things I should be doing. I need to figure out a way to "remap" or rewire my brain to
  replace these types of activities.

  I am still struggling with motivation and productivity at work. I have been wondering if finding an outlet for creativity and building would help. Maybe coding a project on the side (see I did it)? Or more 3D printing? I
  don't know but I do not feel excited anymore about much of anything. Just stuck and stagnant. I will not give up though. I am not built to give up. I might wallow for a little while, but I will get back up. Somehow that
  is one thing that Dad taught me that is postitive. Maybe I should take lessons from that Michael Jordan commercial back in the 1990's where he said, "I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games.
  Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."
